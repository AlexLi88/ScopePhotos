                Ever wonder where the picture of that amazing looking food was taken? Well now you can easily get directions using the Scope app!<br>Here is a quick guideline on how to do it!
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li class="item">Search for a general area on the map (Example: Vancouver downtown)</li>
                <li class="item">Zoom in on one of the streets in the area (Example: Robson Street) and click "get photos"</li>
                <li class="item">The photos taken near the area will now appear. Next, just pick one of the food pics that looks appealing to you and click on it! </li>
                <li class="item">This one looks pretty good! Notice the text in the red box, that’s the location of where this particular photo was taken. Simply click on it, and find out where the photo was taken from!</li>
                <li class="item">Also, once you click on the location, the photo will appear on the map and you will receive personalized directions to the location!</li>
            </ul>

        </div>



        <div class="press_content">

            Hey Everyone!<br>
            We are pleased to announce that Scope has been invited to attend this year’s Collision Conference. The 3-day event takes place on April 26 – April 28!<br>
            What’s Collision, you ask? It’s where visions collide, as one of America’s fastest growing tech conferences that USA Today calls “the anti-CES”. The first year was in Las Vegas, this year it’s in New Orleans- and it’s only getting bigger.
            A Collision Conference Scope will be featured within the app next week, so check it out to see all the exciting photos!
            <br><br>
            Past attendees include Elon Musk and the guys from Uber, among hundreds of others, so yeah, this is a pretty big deal.
            Speakers at this year’s event include the co-founders of WeWork, Slack, and WordPress, along with celebrities such as Brett Favre, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Mick Foley.<br>
            Scope will also be there, pitching our amazing picture app, and we can barely contain our excitement!
            It will be an amazing meeting of the minds, and we can’t wait to bask in that atmosphere of technology, innovation, and potential.

            <div class="main_title">Artificial Intelligence: An Art In Itself</div>
        </div>



        <div class="press_content">

            Artificial Intelligence has the potential to revolutionize technology as we know it, although we’re still a long ways away from Skynet (thank god). But with everyone from Google to Facebook to Elon Musk getting involved, how far away are we from that sci-fi future? We’re getting closer, and whether that means robots eventually take over the world, or human and robot relations… your prediction is as good as mine. Maybe both? The potential for AI is practically limitless.<br>
            What we are doing at Scope is trying to apply AI to revolutionize how we search for and share photos.<br>
            The basic idea is to create a program that can recognize and identify images based on what’s in them, because most search engines today are reliant mainly on tags to find content, images included. This often does not take into account the meaning or context of the photo. That’s why when searching for something, you may end up with unrelated results if the tag is popular enough, because some people will just use a tag to increase exposure regardless of its relevance to the photo.<br>
            With Facebook and Google hard at work developing their own AI programs, what makes Scope unique is our focus on mobile, which also presents its own unique set of challenges, especially when you consider how dependent the tagging is on whoever uploads the photo. Many people don’t tag or even make a caption, which in the eyes of the tag-reliant search engine essentially creates a black hole, where the photo exists somewhere out there but can’t be found. In these cases, only those that follow you would see the image. That’s where image recognition comes in, and we’ve also been experimenting with an auto tag system that would automatically attribute meaning and context to your photo before you post it.<br>
            Recently, there was some big news in the world of AI. Let’s take a look.<br>
            Deepmind, Google’s AI company, has just developed a computer program that has beaten a human Go champion for the first time, 10 years earlier than predicted! Go is an ancient Chinese game with black and white stones that is known for its complexity, and for reference, that famous match where an IBM computer defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov happened almost 20 years ago. So this isn’t just some “Go Go Gadget publicity stunt” (pardon the pun). It’s a huge, symbolic step forward.<br>
            Mark Zuckerberg’s New Year’s resolution was to create his own Jarvis, whom you may remember as Tony Stark’s robot butler from the Ironman and Avengers movies. Zuckerberg’s goal is a version of that, a smart(er) home, where ordinary, everyday objects (like buildings, vehicles, appliances, etc.) are embedded with electronics to connect to the internet. In this case, he’s trying to create a home automation system that could ideally take care of everything from lighting, heating, and security. Imagine never having to adjust another thermostat again.<br>
            Zuckerberg also says AI is nothing to fear, firing shots at the Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence signed by Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Bill Gates, that warns of AI’s potential dangers, up to and including our extinction. As of writing, nobody has responded yet, but this has the potential to be a much more interesting science beef than rapper B.o.B versus Neil de Grasse Tyson on whether the earth is flat.<br>
            AI is an exciting new frontier, that raises many implications, big and small. Our goal is that Scope will be able to recognize and identify images on its own, making it a more intelligent way to share and search for photos in your social circles.<br>
